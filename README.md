# ChatBot

The chatbot has been made using Seq2Seq model. Seq2Seq model or Sequence-to-Sequence model, is a machine learning architecture designed for tasks involving sequential data. It takes an input sequence, processes it, and generates an output sequence. The architecture consists of two fundamental components: an encoder and a decoder. Seq2Seq models have significantly improved the quality of machine translation systems making them an important technology.
1. Project Scope and Objectives: The main aim is to develop a mental health therapist based chatbot using Seq2Seq model. 
2. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a diverse dataset of conversational pairs relevant to the chatbot's domain. Clean and preprocess the data, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of noise. Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
3. Seq2Seq Model Architecture selection:  A suitable seq2seq model architecture is chosen with appropriate hyperparameters including number of layers, hidden units and embedding dimensions.

6. Tokenization and Embedding: Tokenize the input and output sequences, mapping words to numerical representations. Apply word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent words in a continuous vector space. Embedding layers should be trainable to adapt to the specific context of the chatbot.
7. Model Training: Train the Seq2Seq model using the preprocessed dataset. Utilize the training set to optimize the model's parameters through backpropagation. Implement early stopping mechanisms to prevent overfitting. Monitor loss functions and convergence.
8. Evaluation metrics: Define evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the Seq2Seq model. Common metrics include BLEU score, perplexity, and accuracy. Employ the validation set to fine-tune the model and ensure generalization.
9. Hyperparameter Tuning: Iteratively fine-tune hyperparameters based on model performance on the validation set. Adjust learning rates, dropout rates, and other parameters to optimize the Seq2Seq model's performance.
10. Integration with chat platform: Integrate the Seq2Seq-based chatbot into the desired chat platform or application. Ensure compatibility with popular messaging platforms and implement necessary security measures.

The chatbot developed will provide answers to the questions asked by the user. 
If the chatbot does not know answer related to particular question then the user can tell answer to it and that answer will be saved by it for next time displaying the output.
